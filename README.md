In today's data-driven world, businesses thrive on insights derived from raw data. I recently worked on an interactive MS Excel dashboard that not only cleans and transforms data using Power Query but also presents key business KPIs in a visually compelling way.

Hereâ€™s how this dashboard adds value:

âœ… Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Using Power Query, I streamlined messy raw data, added meaningful columns, and prepared it for analysis.

âœ… Dynamic Visualizations â€“ The dashboard showcases sales trends, footfall patterns, and product performance using intuitive graphs and KPIs.

âœ… Insight-Driven Decision Making â€“ By analyzing sales variations across weekdays, peak hours, store locations, and product categories, businesses can optimize operations and boost revenue.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights from the Dashboard:

ðŸ“Œ How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
Sales are highest on Sundays and Mondays, with a slight dip mid-week. Peak sales hours occur in the morning between 8 AM - 10 AM, aligning with the coffee rush.

ðŸ“Œ Are there any peak times for sales activity?
Yes! The highest order volume happens between 8 AM - 10 AM, likely driven by the morning coffee demand. After that, sales fluctuate throughout the day, with a smaller peak around early evening.

ðŸ“Œ What is the total sales revenue for each month?
The dashboard allows tracking monthly sales trends to monitor growth and seasonality.[Data can be updated dynamically per month selection] 

ðŸ“Œ How do sales vary across different store locations?
Among different locations, sales are quite close, but Hellâ€™s Kitchen and Astoria lead in revenue and footfall, while Lower Manhattan follows.

ðŸ“Œ What is the average price/order per person?
With an average order per person being slightly above one, customer buying behavior suggests repeat purchases or bundled orders.

ðŸ“Œ Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?
â˜• Barista Espresso and Brewed Chai Tea are top revenue drivers, while Gourmet Brewed Coffee and Hot Chocolate also show strong sales.

ðŸ“Œ How do sales vary by product category and type?
Coffee-based products dominate with the largest revenue share (~39%), followed by bakery items and other beverages.
